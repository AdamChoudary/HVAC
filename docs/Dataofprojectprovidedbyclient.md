Coverage area - I am unsure of how our website host assures the right audience sees us as available to them.
Our preference, for ad spend and online publications, is a 20-25 mile radius from 3353 Belvedere St NW, Salem, OR 97304.
However - There is a variable distance of 35-42 miles northward to keep and include the city of Portland and all surrounding townships (we keep them as the company started there in early 2019 with between 1,400 and 1,800 accounts on record) and we service calls that come in from Albany, and as far south as Eugene, and Corvallis with discretion to the project size being worth the commute costs.
 Full city of Salem (all zip codes) - this includes what is designated as west Salem.. my side of the river
surrounding Salem is
(west) Independence, Monmouth, Dallas, Rickreall, Willamina, Sheridan
(south) Jefferson, Millersburg
(east) Turner, Aumsville, Sublimity, Stayton, Silverton
(north) Keizer.. aka north Salem, McMinnville, Amity, Dayton, Lafayette, Newberg, Brooks, Gervais, Woodburn, Hubbard
RE: Types of appointments - I will type up a more specific list separately but to say in general we service/repair, maintain and install all types of residential  [whole home ducted and split home ducted and ductless systems] and commercial wall hung or roof mounted packaged unit air controlled systems ((no radiant, no geothermal, no hydro/steam systems, and no boiler services)).. however we will fit a home with a ducted or ductless air controlled system and abandon or sub out the removal of a boiler upon project specific requested services
Residential Diagnostics $190
Commercial Diagnostics $240
 these prices are in current discussion to schedule to be reduced to stay competitive with other companies that follow the lecherous "got-cha" pricing ploys such as only $89 diagnostic all while you can be assured nearly every call "needs parts replaced" to get them up to billing averages of $400-$700 per service call - shady, but unfortunately common practice in many trades
Hours of operation -
Office/Calls - We will take calls 24 hrs with AI - between 7a and 8:30p for phones answered by me when/where able
Field/site work - We schedule regular services between 8a and 4:30p
 weekends/holidays - we perform services at company discretion on case by case basis.. typically these instances are reserved for hot or cold storms that can have our client in great discomfort or in unsafe indoor temperatures - - we are also a small enough operation that this type call for help is best reserved mostly for people at the most threat to health ..people with infants and senior citizens
For pricing on weekend or emergency calls - there is no static price in play.. this too is treated on a case by case basis by answering the question (at what cost to the company will we be rendering the service) - at some point I will have a static tier of prices that we may choose to amend downward (discount) based on per-caller mitigating factors - this is to say during one winter ice storm 2 winters ago we charged the regular $190 residential diagnostic services and added $50 weekend call, + $55 emergency call, + $40 commute hazard pay ..totaling $335 for each diagnostic call.
Many of my competitors were exasperatingly thievingly high in that same storm with some charging well over $500-$650 just to show up even if the fix was under 10 minutes to thaw a condensation drip line
 Out of service area any day of the week any day of the year is judged on a case by case basis ((variables such as, is the client 5 miles outside general area or 25 miles extra - is the commute highway speed or country road - if we don't have a not-yet-known part on the truck "rolling shop" how far rural are they to the nearest supplier all in the attempt to most treat fairly while also in company interest charge what our involvement will inevitably be)) these all add at the very least $50 while generally not more than $110 added to the static $190 diagnostic call fee to cover fuel expense and my guys are paid their full pay rate windshield time
other rendered services pricing I will add to the separate submission that includes "types of appointments"

Lead sources
https://www.valleyviewhvac.com/ our website hosted with HiBu who also handles advert campaigns.. banner ads, blog posts, name drops on rando sites, etc where all, dunno, but they funnel all prospects to and through the website including to the published phone numbers on the site (for tracking) all funnel to the company main number ending in 6763
https://www.yelp.com/biz/valley-view-hvac-salem-2 ever so reluctantly we are present on yelp - we despise the shady tactics and "lead gen" billing tactics they implement, yet with a long 6 year presence and 113 posted reviews.. here we are
https://www.thumbtack.com/or/salem/furnace-installation/valley-view-hvac/service/482345969648861195
thumbtack,  where we have our paid leads turned off as the business model there is also cash-grab terrible.. they "sell // divvy" out each lead to 4, 5, 7 contractors and charge all of us $25 to $150 no matter the outcome of the customer's reason to reach out for services

this page is from 2019 ish
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555367747674
A newly set up page, however I don't think it was ever set properly as a landing page - set up while the other one is tied to a previous owner and I have had exhaustive, no result, years of attempting to pull the page into mine and only my direct control ((I't is secure having kicked the previous employees out and securely changed login info and I can author and edit the page fully, yet it is trapped in a link to the previous business owner's fb biz page with no help from fb after 8-9x requesting release of the page))
Standard Appointment length
 Diagnostic - a diag can be as quick as 20-30 min while the visit is scheduled for and price structured to include up to a full hour on site
Proposal - new equipment proposals are typically 20 - 50 minutes yet each project may vary greatly to the time and attention needed
Repair - repairs, post diagnosis of the issue(s) at hand, can run a full range between 15 minutes to over 6.5 hours on average to perform and follow with operational testing
Installation - System/Equipment installations can be as little as 2.5 to 4 hrs while also taking up to 2-3 full days depending on the scope of work involved and how many crew members are scheduled
System installation RANGE for prices.. we are very conservative as to who we discuss prices with prior to getting a person on site to best assess the project scope - that said:
one piece of equipment ((base level Furnace or Air Handler)) can be as low as $4,900 upwards to $7,900 based on equip size and other factors
one piece of equipment ((base line AC or Heat Pump)) can be as low as $6,200 upwards to $9,400 with all the varietal reasons for such a spread
Full suite of new equipment ranges from $9,800 all the way up to $17,500 or more depending on scope of work and equip size/type etc
Duct system repair or partial replacement can be as low as a few hundred to a few thousand
Duct system - whole new system installation can run between $4,500 and over $12,000
Brand - Voice - Company personality
respectful, empathetic, patient, informative, educational, neighborly, warm while also energetic, earnest, fun, funny, personable
Words to use // Not use
use - consultation, complimentary, inclusive, thorough, diligent, trusted, proposal, quality
not use - free, cheap, low cost (parts) - always push back on requests "to just give me a quote over the phone" and avoid "just want you to install the parts/units I have or will purchase separately" as that never ends well 
Our Discounting tiers - our client class recognition
Senior Community Member
Veteran Appreciation
Educator thanks
First Responder recognition
Each of these are a variety of savings - 10% ish.. the ish is because in some larger repairs or system installations the percentage is not spread over all facets of the workmanship - while we discount the product or materials we may not attribute full percentage savings on the labor side of the project or third party involvement ((plumbers, crane, sub contractors of all sorts))
What we do offer (not published on our website or anywhere else in print) is a combined stacking of multiple qualifiers such as a retired educator that is also a military veteran - this however is not equal 2x 10% ..no, instead it averages about 14% for the both and if a third tier is added it may save the client up to 16% as a maximum offered savings ceiling - a topmost price reduction
